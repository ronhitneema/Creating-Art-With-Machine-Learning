Neural Style Transfer: Creating Art with Deep Learning using tf.keras and eager execution

Neural style transfer is a technique that combines the content of one image with the style of another image to create a new image that has the content of the first image but is styled in the same way as the second image. This technique utilizes deep learning and optimization algorithms to achieve the desired artistic effect.

To implement neural style transfer using tf.keras and eager execution, we can follow the general steps outlined below:

Enable eager execution: Eager execution allows us to evaluate operations immediately, making the implementation clearer and more readable.

Define content and style representations: We need to extract the content and style representations from intermediate layers of a pre-trained model. By accessing these intermediate layers, we can describe the content and style of input images. VGG19, a pre-trained image classification network, is commonly used for this purpose.

Create the model: Load the VGG19 model and feed the input tensor to it. This will allow us to extract the feature maps of the content, style, and generated images.

Define loss functions: The loss functions consist of the content loss and style loss. The content loss measures the difference between the intermediate representations of the content image and the generated image. The style loss compares the Gram matrices of the style image and the generated image, capturing the correlation between different feature maps.

Optimize for loss function: Use an optimizer, such as Adam, to minimize the combined content and style loss. Iteratively update the generated image to minimize the loss and generate an image that matches the content of the content image and the style of the style image.

By following these steps, you can implement neural style transfer using tf.keras and eager execution. This technique allows you to blend the content and style of different images, creating unique and artistic outputs.
